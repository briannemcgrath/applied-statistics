# Applied Statistics Assignment Repository

![Applied Statistics](image/applied%20statistics%20picture.jpg)

This repository contains the coursework for the Applied Statistics module. The assessment is designed to demonstrate understanding and application of various statistical techniques, including permutations, combinations, normal distribution, $t$-tests, ANOVA, and hypothesis testing. The highlight of this project is the analysis of the [PlantGrowth](data/plant_growth.csv) dataset to explore the statistical significance of treatment of effects on plant growth. 


## **Project Structure**: 

- [Tasks](tasks.ipynb/) - Contains a series of tasks that introduce core statistical concepts and tests. 
- [Project](project.ipynb/) - Focuses on a real-world dataset and requires applying multiple statistical tests ($t$-tests and ANOVA) to analyse the effects on plant growth. 


## **Prerequisites:**
Before starting, ensure the following tools and libraries are installed:  
- **Python:** Version 3.6 or later.  
- Required libraries: 
    - `numpy`
    - `scipy`
    - `matplotlib`
    - `itertools` 
    - `pandas`

## **Tasks:**

### **Task One: Permutations and Combinations - Lady Tasting Tea Experiment.** 
- This task calculates the probabilities associated with a modified version of the Lady Tasting Tea experiment. 
### **Task Two: numpy's Normal Distribution.**
- This task evaluates whether a sample generated by nump.random.normal() resembles a true normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test and a histogram with a PDF overlay. 
### **Task Three: $t$-Test Calculation** 
- This task calculates the t-statistic based on a given dataset, using Python. 
### **Task Four: ANOVA**
- This task estimates the probability of committing a type II error in ANOVA when testing for differences in means across three samples. 

## **Project:**
Analyse the PlantGrowth dataset using $t$-tests and ANOVA to investigate the effects of treatments on plant growth. 

## **How it Works:**

## **Files and Directories:**
### **Key Files:**
- `tasks.ipynb`: Contains the code for the statistical tasks. 
- `project.ipynb`: Contains the analysis for the PlantGrowth dataset.
