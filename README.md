# Applied Statistics Assignment Repository

This repository contains code and resources related to the tasks and project carried out for the Applied Statistics module. 

## Table of Contents: 

- [Tasks](tasks.ipynb/)
- [Project](project.ipynb/)

## **Overview:**

## **Prerequisites:**
Before running the code, ensure you have the following: 
- Python 
- Required libraries: 
    - `numpy`
    - `scipy`
    - `matplotlib`
    - `math` 

### **Tasks:**

- Task One: Permutations and Combinations - Lady Tasting Tea Experiment. This task calculates the probabilities associated with a modified version of the Lady Tasting Tea experiment. 
- Task Two: numpy's Normal Distribution. This task evaluates whether a sample generated by nump.random.normal() resembles a true normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test and a histogram with a PDF overlay.
