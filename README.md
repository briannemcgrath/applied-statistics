# Applied Statistics Assignment Repository

![Applied Statistics](image/applied%20statistics%20picture.jpg)

This repository contains the coursework for the Applied Statistics module. The assessment is designed to demonstrate understanding and application of various statistical techniques, including permutations, combinations, normal distribution, $t$-tests, ANOVA, and hypothesis testing. The highlight of this project is the analysis of the [PlantGrowth](data/plant_growth.csv) dataset to explore the statistical significance of treatment of effects on plant growth. 


## **Project Structure**: 

- [Tasks](tasks.ipynb/) - Contains a series of tasks that introduce core statistical concepts and tests. 
- [Project](project.ipynb/) - Focuses on a real-world dataset and requires applying multiple statistical tests ($t$-tests and ANOVA) to analyse the effects on plant growth. 


## **Prerequisites:**
Before starting, ensure the following tools and libraries are installed:  
- **Python:** Version 3.6 or later.  
- Required libraries: 
    - `numpy`
    - `scipy`
    - `matplotlib`
    - `itertools` 
    - `pandas`

## **Tasks:**

### **Task 1: Permutations and Combinations - Lady Tasting Tea Experiment.** 
- This task calculates the probabilities associated with a modified version of the Lady Tasting Tea experiment. 
### **Task 2: numpy's Normal Distribution.**
- This task evaluates whether a sample generated by nump.random.normal() resembles a true normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test and a histogram with a PDF overlay. 
### **Task 3: $t$-Test Calculation** 
- This task calculates the t-statistic based on a given dataset, using Python. 
### **Task 4: ANOVA**
- This task estimates the probability of committing a type II error in ANOVA when testing for differences in means across three samples. 

## **Project:**
Analyse the PlantGrowth dataset using $t$-tests and ANOVA to investigate the effects of treatments on plant growth. The dataset contains results from an experiment designed to compare the dried weight yields of plants under different treatment conditions. 

## **How it Works:**
### **Tasks Notebook [tasks.ipynb](tasks.ipynb):**
- Clone the repository to your local machine using Git or open it in a GitHub Codespace. I personally, use Visual Studio Code. Ensure all required libraries are installed - `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`. 
- Open `tasks.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or your preferred environment. This notebook contains workings for Task 1 - 4 as listed above. 

### **Project Notebook [project.ipynb](project.ipynb):**
- Clone the repository to your local machine using Git or open it in a GitHub Codespace. The dataset for this project can be found in the `data` directory. Ensure all required libraries are installed - `pandas`, `scipy`, `scipy.stats`. 
- Open `project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook on your preferred environment. This notebook contains the analysis of the PlantGrowth dataset. In it you will see an overview of the dataset, $t$-test, and ANOVA analysis. 

## **Files and Directories:**
### **Key Files:**
- `tasks.ipynb`: Contains the code for the statistical tasks. 
- `project.ipynb`: Contains the analysis for the PlantGrowth dataset. 
- `data/`: Contains dataset used in the project. 
- `image/`: Contains images used throughout the repository.
