    "A t-test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups and how they are related. It helps assess if any observed difference is due to chance or if it reflects a real effect. In this case, we will use it to compare the plant weights between the two treatment groups `trt1` and `trt2`. \n",

    "\n",
    "When analysing more than two groups, it is more appropriate to use ANOVA instead of performing several $t$-tests. Here's why: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reduces Errors:** Running multiple $t$-tests increase the risk of false positives (Type I errors). ANOVA avoids this by comparing all groups at once, keeping the error rate low. \n",
    "2. **More Efficient:** ANOVA tests all groups in a single step, saving time and avoiding repeated calculations. \n",
    "3. **Broad Comparison:** ANOVA checks for differences across all groups together, while $t$-tests only compares two groups at a time. \n",
    "4. **Follow-Up Testing:** If ANOVA shows a difference, additional tests like Tukey's HSD can identify which groups are different without increasing errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA is better for analysing more than two groups because it is accurate, efficient, and provides a complete comparison. \n",
