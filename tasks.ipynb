    "This Python code calculates the probabilities of selecting the correct cups in an altered version of the *Lady Tasting Tea* experiment, where there are 12 cupsâ€”6 with milk first and 6 with tea first. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Required Library**:\n",
    "   - The `itertools` library is imported for generating combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define Cups**:\n",
    "   - A list of cups is created, with the first six cups containing milk and the last six containing tea.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generate Combinations**:\n",
    "   - All possible combinations of 6 cups from the 12 are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Count Favorable Outcomes**:\n",
    "   - The number of combinations with exactly 6 cups containing milk is counted.\n",
    "   - The number of combinations with at least 5 cups containing milk is also counted.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Calculate Probabilities**:\n",
    "   - The total number of combinations is determined.\n",
    "   - Probabilities for selecting exactly 6 correct cups and at least 5 correct cups are calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Print Results**:\n",
    "   - The total combinations and the calculated probabilities are printed.\n",
